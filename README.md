# weather-home-ANZ-regional-mask-

This mask defines various regions across Aotearoa New Zealand for the w@h model, which operates at a spatial resolution of 0.44°×0.44° over the entire region. The purpose of this mask is to identify and classify distinct geographical areas within Aotearoa New Zealand following Mullan (1998) paper. Mullan used rotated empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of monthly precipitation departures from climatology (1951-1980) to regionalise precipitation.
